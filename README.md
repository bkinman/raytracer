# raytracer
A simple ray tracer written in Python (What?!)

This ray tracer is based on the implementation described in Peter Shirley's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5AODD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01B5AODD8&linkCode=as2&tag=inonwe09-20&linkId=OPNJXXJY2IBCMEGE">Ray Tracing  in one weekend</a>.

My motivations for writing this ray tracer were as follows:
* I want to write a full-featured application in Python.
* I want to have a solid understanding of why Python is slower than C/C++.
* I want to figure out exactly how performant I can make this codebase without moving away from Python implementation.
* I want to become more competent with some of math associated with computer graphics.
* I'm a DIY kind of guy, and am excited about creating a tool that I can incorporate into some later project.
* I want to use what I learn from this project as the basis of a future GPU-based tracer.
* I like creating pretty pictures.
